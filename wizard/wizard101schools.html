                <li>The magic of Fire, Ice, and Storm comes from ancient Titans that ruled the world in the Days Before. The magic of Myth, Life, and Death come from the power of the mind, body, and spirit of the Wizard casting them. The magic of Balance combines all of them.

The Astral Schools of Sun, Moon and Star are reserved for the strongest Wizards and are designed to work as supplementary spells.</li>
